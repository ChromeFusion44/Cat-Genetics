# Punnet²
Punnet², formerly known as cat-genetics, is a python program for doing 2x2 punnet sqaures and getting some basic information about the offspring's genotypes.

Here is an example of what the output of the program looks like, given that you input Bb and Bb for the two parent genotypes:

|      | **B**    | **b**   |
| ---- |:----:| ----:|
| **B**   | BB | Bb |
| **b**   | Bb  | bb |

25% BB

50% Bb

25% bb
