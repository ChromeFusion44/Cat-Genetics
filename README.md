# Punnet²
Punnet², formerly known as cat-genetics, is a python program for doing 2x2 punnet sqaures and getting some basic information about the offspring's genotypes.

What's a punnet square, you ask?
The punnet sqaure is a tool in biology that is used to predict the outcome of a specific crossing, breeding, mating, etc. of two organisms.
A punnet square is created by placing the possible gametes (sex cells) of which a parent will pass down to their offspring on the top and left outsides of the table for each parent, and then combining the parents gametes to get the genotypes of the offspring.

If that sounded really confusing, you probably need to know some bio terms first.

Gene - a reigon of DNA that does a certain thing in an organism.

Allele - a specific form of a gene that makes the DNA do its thing a bit differently. For example, having different alleles of genes involved in eye color could give you either brown or blue eyes - one allele makes them blue, a different one makes them brown.

Gamete - a sex cell (sperm or egg) that combines with another sex cell using DNA from the parents to produce another organism, or offspring.

Genotype - an organism's genetic makeup (so one allele or another).

Phenotype - what an organism physically expresses (ex. brown hair or blond hair).

Basically, a punnet square aims to predict what how likely two parent organisms' offspring will be of a certain genotype, and therefore phenotype as well. Sound complicated? Probably. Here's an actual punnet square to help you out:

|      | **B**    | **b**   |
| ---- |:----:| ----:|
| **B**   | BB | Bb |
| **b**   | bb  | bb |

Each parent can either pass down a "B" or a "b" allele in their gamete.

We see that in the results, there is...

...a 25% chance of the offspring being BB.

...a 50% chance of the offspring being Bb.

...a 25% chance of the offspring being bb.

Now what if I told you that this was for eye color, and that kids with the genotypes BB or Bb will have brown eyes, but kids with the genotype bb have blue eyes?

The information suddenly becomes a lot more useful and relevant to real life!

Punnet squares are used to make all sorts of genetic predictions ranging from things like eye color to prescense of debilitating genetic diseases.
